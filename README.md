# Qworshipmic System
The Qworship SDK is designed to provide a suite of features aimed at enhancing the experience of using the Qworship microphone. It offers real-time audio processing, voice command recognition, text transcription, Bible verse lookup, and more. This suite comes with the installation and user guide towards a better experience with the mic

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Speech-to-Text**: Google's Speech-to-Text API or any other Speech-to-Text API
- **Noise Reduction**: librosa, a Python package for audio and music analysis
- **Voice Enhancement**: scikit-voice or a similar package
- **Bible Verse Search**: Utilize a Bible API or scrape verses from a reputable source
- **Translation**: Google's Translate API

### Pseudocode with Voice-Activated Command for Bible Verse Search

- The `listen_for_voice_commands` method listens for specific voice commands from the real-time audio feed. It uses the `detect_voice_command` method to look for a specific phrase ("Open your Bibles to") in the audio data.
- When the voice command is detected, `extract_verse_reference` is used to extract the verse reference from the audio following the wake phrase. 
- Finally, the code searches for the Bible verse using `search_bible_verses` (which you'd have implemented already).

### Real-time Considerations:

1. **Buffering and Queues**: The code uses a queue (`audio_queue`) to hold incoming audio data until it's ready to be processed.
2. **Threading**: The audio recording and processing are run in separate threads to ensure that neither process blocks the other.
3. **Callbacks**: The `sd.InputStream` object calls a callback function (`callback`) every time it receives a new chunk of audio data. This is standard for real-time audio processing.

Notting that real-time streaming to Google's Speech-to-Text API is also possible but more involved. It would require creating a gRPC channel and streaming the audio data to Google's servers for real-time transcription.
